== Eclipse Helios ==

You can load this Scala project in Eclipse with Scala IDE.

The version of Eclipse tested was Eclipse Helios. Add this update site to
Eclipse to download the correct Scala IDE:

http://download.scala-ide.org/nightly-update-helios-2.8.0.final

Once everything is downloaded, run "sbt eclipse" in the main directory
of the OpenPit project. This will create the directory structure that
Eclipse looks for.

Then you may go to Eclipse and use:
  File -> Import -> [Expand General] Existing Projects into Workspace
