Hints for texturing:

    Load art/terrain.xcf in gimp.

    Use the rectangular select tool ('R') to outline the tile you're working on.
    (Add guides as necessary)

    "Float" the selection (ctrl-shift-L) so that it is its own layer.

    Now you can work on the texture and use "Layer | Transform | Offset"
    (ctrl-shift-o) by half to flip the texture around to blend the seams.

    When done, "anchor layer" (ctrl-h) to drop the floated selection back down.


A starting point with a photo:

    Pick a picture with flat lighting.  Google "high pass filter" texture
    techniques to flatten images with bright/dark spots.

    Use "Filters | Map | Make seamless".  This will blend the image with
    the offset version of itself to ensure it tiles.  This can be tricky
    with realistic textures, but this one won't be realistic long.

    Scale the image (with "good" scaling like cubic) down to 64x64.

    Blur it once.  This reduces the contrast of the final result.

    Scale the image (with "Interpolation: none") down to 16x16.  The
    nearest neighbor resampling leaves you with a higher frequency result
    which helps it tile and makes it fit the "16 bit" theme.
