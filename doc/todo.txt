windows
    consider launch4j, jsmooth windows launchers

opengl
    experiment with different combos of glTexParameteri with mipmaps
    generate 'nearest' own mipmaps?  yes, especially important with texture atlas
    "upgrade" from displaylists to vbos

render distant terrain in a back buffer and use it as a skybox

implement a skysphere with meaningful celestial behavior and recognizable
constellations (not necessarly Earth's)

octree
    right now the tree bottoms out in nulls which imply "air" but it
    should be possible for any level of the tree to be filled with any
    block type (think dirt, stone, water)

    the "leaf" level could be bigger than 2x2x2.  it might be more efficient
    for it to be much bigger, 4x4x4, 8x8x8, ...

    it needs various bounded iterators, by volume, by type.  filter should
    be passed in for the best possible pruning.

    need to memoize certain properties (like "fully enclosed") to make good
    rendering decisions
